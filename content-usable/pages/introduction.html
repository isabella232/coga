      <h1>Introduction</h1>

      <p>
        Making websites and applications that are friendly for people with
        cognitive impairments affects every part of design and development.
      </p>
      <p>
        Traditionally, accessibility focused on making the interface usable for 
    people with sensory and physical impairments (vision, hearing and/or mobility). 
    Some accessibility features will help people with cognitive impairments. 
    Often the issues that affect people with cognitive and learning disabilities  
    include design, context, structure, language, usability, and other factors that are 
    difficult to include in general guidelines.
      </p>
      <p>
         Some design patterns create barriers for people with disabilities.  The patterns presented in this 
     document have been designed to avoid such barriers for people with cognitive and learning disabilities. 
     While this guidance may improve usability for all, these patterns are <strong>essential</strong> for some people with cognitive 
     and learning impairments to be able to use content independently.
      </p>
    <p>The Objectives and Patterns build on the:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>  <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/coga-user-research/">Cognitive Accessibility User Research</a>,</li>
        <li>  <a href="https://w3c.github.io/coga/issue-papers/">Cognitive Accessibility Issue Papers</a>, and</li>
        <li>  <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/coga-gap-analysis/">Cognitive Accessibility Gap Analysis and Roadmap</a>.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>      
        <p>
     The Objectives and Patterns presented here provide <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/#supplement">supplemental guidance</a> 
     beyond the requirements of WCAG. They address accessibility barriers that could not be 
     included in the normative WCAG 2.x specification and may not otherwise be addressed.

          <h3>How to Use this Document</h3>
          
          <p>This document provides information on the development process and design options for making websites and applications that are more usable and accessible for people with 
          cognitive impairments. It is organized by high level objectives which are listed along with user stories in Section 3.</p>
           
          <p>This document is divided into parts.  Each part can be used when needed by different groups in the development team. Following the advice in this document as much as possible

        <h1>
          Background about People with Learning and Cognitive Disabilities and
          the Web
        </h1>
        <p>Cognitive and learning disabilities include long-term, short-term, and permanent difficulties relating to cognitive functions, such as:</p>
      <ul><li>Perception, memory and attention;</li>
      <li>Learning and orientation; and</li>
      <li>Visual, verbal or numerical thinking.</li></ul>

    <p>
          Design, structure and language choices can make content inaccessible to 
      people with cognitive and learning disabilities.  Examples may include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            People with impaired short term memory may be unable to recall
            passwords or copy access codes. They may have trouble or be unable
            to remember new symbols and interface paradigms;
          </li>
      <li>
        People with impaired working memory will only be able to hold one to 
        three items in their memory at the same time. This can make it difficult to 
        hold information temporarily or copy access codes. 
      </li>
          <li>
            People with different processing speed capabilities may need
            additional time to understand the design relationships and volume of
            information on screen;
          </li>
          <li>
            People with language related disabilities may need simple clear
            language and instructions. Some may rely on supporting graphics and
            familiar symbols to understand content;
          </li>
          <li>
            People with social and/or communication disabilities may need clear
            literal language and may not understand metaphors or non-literal
            text and symbols;
          </li>
          <li>
            People with impairments that affect or comprehending mathematical concepts may not understand or confuse numerical
            references such as percentages;
          </li>
          <li>
            People who have issues with keeping or regaining focus may have
            difficulty completing a simple task if there are a lot of
            distractions and interruptions. They may need headers and signposts
            to help them regain the context after their attention has been lost
            (including in multimedia);
          </li>
          <li>
            Many groups will need support to minimize errors and complete their
            task. They will struggle with cognitive fatigue when completing complex, multi-stage processes such as
            filling out forms or entering data correctly or finding the content
            or feature that they need.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These difficulties may sometimes also be experienced by users in the
          general population due to environmental or situational barriers, such
          as when they are trying to use a website when they are distracted. For
          example, working on a mobile device while in an unfamiliar or noisy
          situation can place an additional cognitive load on users by
          splitting their attention. However, for users with cognitive and
          learning disabilities, these difficulties are likely to be persistent
          and significant. As a result, they could be unable to access content and complete these tasks independently.
        </p>
  
        <p>
          Cognitive and learning disabilities are usually hidden difficulties and may be age related. The
          terminology and definitions used for cognitive disabilities varies
          between countries and users are less likely to have a formal diagnosis
          of a disability than individuals with physical and sensory
          difficulties. Often, only some functions are impaired while other cognitive functions are unaffected. For example, someone with dyslexia may be a fantastic engineer.
          Sometimes, cognitive disability may include intellectual impairments that affect comprehension alongside written and spoken
          expression. People may also experience more than one type of  cognitive and learning disability. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Mental health issues can also result in cognitive difficulties, such as difficulty focusing, cognitive fatigue or reduced memory. 
      Overall, by addressing barriers to accessibility for
          users with cognitive and learning disabilities, improvements to
          digital technologies can be achieved and there is the potential to
          improve user experience for everyone.

        <h1>Building the User into the Development Process</h1>
        <p>
          Some aspects of making web content and applications friendly for
          people with cognitive and learning disabilities are best dealt with as part of the
          overall design process. For most organizations there should be scope
          included for a
          <a href="https://www.usability.gov/what-and-why/user-centered-design.html">user-centered design process</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Key parts of this process for people with cognitive and learning disabilities should
          be:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Including the needs of users with cognitive and learning disabilities in the
            context of user needs and requirements;
          </li>
          <li>
            Including people with cognitive and learning disabilities in research methods such
            as usability testing.
          </li>
      <li>Including people with cognitive and learning disabilities in the design and development team.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If people with cognitive impairments are included in the usability
          testing and their feedback is accounted for, the
          website will be easier to use for everyone, including people who are experiencing stress or mental health issues.
