      <h1>Appendix: Testable Statements for Each Pattern</h1>
<p>There  are ongoing efforts to make testable statements for each design patterns with corresponding test processes, failure examples, etc.</p> 

<p>Note that in many cases, the testable statement only covers the part of the design pattern that is automatically testable. A full table of the draft testable options are available at  <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/task-forces/coga/wiki/Testable_Statements_for_Each_Pattern">Testable Statements for COGA Design Patterns</a>.</p>

<p>The Cognitive Accessibility Taskforce intends to continue working on these statements as a supplement to the design guide.</p>
