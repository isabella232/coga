          <h1>User Stories</h1>
          <p>This section contains user stories, followed by the user needs that relate to them. They are divided into the same objectives as the design guide above.</p>
      <p>Note that for people with learning and cognitive disabilities, meeting  these needs often is the difference between being able to use the site or not be able to use it at all. This may also be true for people with mental health issues or under temporary stress.  </p>
      <p>User needs for people with learning and cognitive disabilities (COGA) are often helpful for other users, although they can usually manage to use the site without these user needs being met.   </p>

          <h2>Objective 1: Help Users Understand What Things are and How to Use Them</h2>
      <section>
      <h4>User Story: Clear Purpose</h4>
      <p>As a user with a memory impairment, attention impairment and/or executive function impairment or as a user with a communication disability who uses symbols,
               I need to know the purpose of the content so that I know if I am in the right place, and what I am doing even if I lose attention and focus for a time. </p>

      <p>This also includes the following user needs:</p><ul><li>

      I know what the website offers, or if I should move on.</li><li>
      I know what features and content are on this page or if I should move on.</li><li>
      I always recognize where I am in the architecture of the website, application or multi-step process, even after I get distracted.</li><li>
      I know the relationship between this page and the site/task, even after I get distracted.</li><li>
      I can easily see the context and purpose of the page.</li><li>
      In videos and multimedia: I know what is going to be in the video, I can jump to the content I need, and I can restore context if I get distracted.</li></ul>

      <h4>User Story: Clear Operation</h4>

    <p>As a user with a memory impairment, a learning disability, or a communication disability who uses symbols, and/or executive function impairment, I find it hard to learn new interface design patterns. I need to know which controls are available and how to use them so that the site is usable for me.</p>

      <p>This also includes the following user needs: </p><ul><li>
      I understand my options and the tasks I can perform  and I can identify the controls I can interact with in order to complete actions. </li><li> 
      I know how to use all the controls and the effects of each action. </li><li>
      The interface is designed so that I rarely touch controls by accident</li><li>
      I do not try to activate elements that are not controls. Otherwise I just think the site is broken and give up. </li><li>
      Controls do not move unexpectedly as I am using them. </li><li>
      I know the consequence of each action, such as sending information, changing settings, changing the context or closing the application. </li></ul>

          <section>
    <h4>User Story: Symbols (pictographic or ideographic that represent concepts)</h4>
    <p>As a user with complex communication needs that may include a mild language impairment, I want symbols that help me understand the content.</p> 
    <p>This also includes the following user needs: </p><ul><li>
    I need symbols to help understand essential content, such as controls and section headings.</li><li>
    I need symbols that I understand and are familiar to me; recognizable, commonly used symbols; or personalizable.  </li><li>
    I need symbols placed above the text to link the meaning of the words with the images. </li></ul>
    
    <p>
      As a user with a severe language impairment, who has managed to learn a symbol vocabulary, I need to have symbols on top of each phrase and very simplified language. Of course it is best if I understand the symbols and they are the ones I have learnt (via personalization).

      I can reach important information and the controls I need without scrolling or carrying out other actions. They are not hidden or off screen.</li><li>
      I can easily identify content that I need, and do not need.  Information I need to know and important information stands out, or is the first thing I read  and does not get lost in the noise of less important information. </li><li>
      I can get to the feature I need using the minimum number of easy steps.</li><li>
      I know the starting point for each specific task, such as applying for a job.</li><li>
      I find the design familiar such that user interface elements such as menus, buttons and design components as well as elements common to many websites such as help and search are where I expect them to be and do not move unexpectedly. </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Objective 8: Support Adaptation and Personalization</h2>
      <section><h4>User Story: Adapt</h4>

      <p>As a user with short and medium term memory impairment and weak executive function, I need a familiar interface so that I do not need to figure out and remember new interfaces.  This may take a few weeks of repetition and I may not manage to learn it all if I have a condition affecting learning new things, such as dementia.   </p>

      <p>This also includes the following user needs:</p><ul><li> 

      I need (a version of) the interface to be familiar to me, that I recognize and know what will happen.</li><li>
      I need the controls to be  consistently positioned on the screen where I expect them to be. </li><li>
      I need content delivered in an easy to understand language or an easy-to-understand mode (like short, understandable, video clips).</li><li>
      I need to be able to find and select the content format or version of the content that is easiest for me to understand. </li><li>
      I need alternatives to spoken and written language such as icons, symbols or pictures.</li><li>
      I need personalized  symbols  or pictures that I can recognize immediately, as learning new ones takes a long time. </li><li>
      When I do not know a word I need I need the symbols and pictures that I know and recognize. </li><li>
      I need video and pictures that help me understand the content without so much reading of text.</li><li>
      I need my additional support features from widgets or extensions. For example, I have an extension that  helps me  correctly enter words, grammar and use punctuation as well as read the page to me. </li><li>
      I need "easy to use" gestures on a touch screen that do not confuse me (or the possibility of alternative access).</li><li>
      I need to be able to express my ideas without so many words, such as using speech recognition or pictures (I have a program, where I select a word and it gives me a picture). </li><li>
      I often need more white space to be added between lines, sentences, phrases and chunks.</li><li>
      I need alternatives for mathematical content, that do not rely on mathematical concepts.</li><li>
      I often need less content without extra options and features as sometimes I cannot function at all when there is too much cognitive overload. </li><li>
      I need to be able to find the extra features when I want them. </li></ul>
